To combat more effectively tax evasion and tax fraud at national level, at European level and at global level, the OECD has developed internationally recognised common standards of transparency and information exchange. Legal areas have been invited to include the automatic exchange of financial account information in their respective national legal systems. In the framework of good tax administration Belgium is forming part of the jurisdictions engaged in the implementation of these international standards for the automatic exchange of information. The exchange of information is considered necessary for the purpose of the task of general interest, since Belgium has been invited to include the automatic exchange of financial account information in its jurisdiction to its sole place of interest in respect of European interest.The Royal Decree was first amended by the Royal Decree of 13 June 2018, published in the Belgian Official Journal on 20 June 2018.
