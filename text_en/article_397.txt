Special power decision of the Brussels Capital Government No 2020/047 concerning the granting of a commercial lease loan to tenants in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis Report to the Government of Enhavig does not implement a regional aid measure in favour of both traders and craftsmen tenants - and in particular those forced by the application of the federal health rules to close their establishments - and of the owners of commercial immovable property who agree to cancel during one or more months the payment of the rent on these goods. The measure consists of a loan to the tenant for an amount corresponding to one to four months rent, including charges. The grant of this loan, which is paid directly to the owner, is subject to the payment of the rent itself, including charges, for a period of one to four months. The measure is intended to compensate for the liquidity problems of the Brussels merchants and craftsmen-hirers and at the same time to the owners of these premises, who are not liable to the rent on the basis of any kind of the rent to the company.In addition, since at least 18 March 2020 (the date of the first lockdown), the tenant must have the main activity of his trade or craft activity, have an active establishment unit in it and at the same date are not lagging behind in the rental payments. There is no condition relating to the compulsory closure of the commercial property. Since March 2020, many different health measures have been taken so that companies that do not suffer any loss of turnover due to the health crisis in the minority, even among companies that have never had to conclude a penalty. In this way, the commercial lease loan can also benefit traders and craftsmen who have not had to close but are subject to the economic consequences of the health measures.On the basis of agreements with one or more landlords, but the cumulative amount of all loans to the same tenant may not exceed 35.000 euros. The application for this arrangement - which will be entirely digital - will be established on the basis of a model agreement between tenant and landlord and a declaration on honour. The deadline for submission of applications is fixed on 30 June 2021, with a final payout on 31 December 2021. The measure will therefore extinguish at the latest on 31 December 2023 (subject to any pending disputes), taking into account the payment period of 2 years. The commercial rental loans are granted under the European de minimis Regulation. Article 15 of the draft decision determines the categories of personal data which can be processed, the purposes of processing, the controllers and the retention period of time for which it is granted.This requirement is therefore deleted from Article 3. The Council of State considers (point 7) that the definition of the commercial lease loan provided for in Article 1 is more confusing than the other way around. In view of the content of Article 2 that definition can be removed. Article 12 provides that the loan is to be paid on a Belgian sight account in the name of the landlord. The Council of State does not consider itself able to check the limitation to a Belgian bank account is not at odds with European legal principles such as that relating to free movement. The authors of the draft refer to their justification cited in point 9 of the opinion. Opinion of the Economic and Social Council (Brupartners) and the Data Protection Authority asked Brupartners to issue an urgent opinion. This opinion was issued on 11 December 2020, subject to an approval at its next plenary meeting. The following opinion should be noted. The loan was initially limited to an amount of 25.000 euros.Article 6 of the Agreement, which will form an appendix to the lease agreement, is supplemented by Article 6 in the light of the proposal of the GBA.

Furthermore, the cases in which a tenant is not eligible for the loan or in which he is obliged to repay them in advance (Articles 16 and 17). Finally, the Brussels Capital Government (hereinafter referred to as the Government) is authorized, even after the end of the special powers, to amend the proposed scheme on a number of points (Article 18) and the entry into force of the decision to be taken pursuant to Article 19).The Court of First Instance held that, in order for a commercial lease to be granted to the public in the light of the above Article 1 of the Law of 30 April 1951, it is necessary, in so far as it is possible, in so far as it is possible, for the purposes of Article 1 of the Law of 30 April 1951, for the purposes of a commercial lease to be granted to the general public in respect of a commercial lease to be granted to the general public within the meaning of Article 1 of the Law of 30 April 1951, that the term "trade lease" be interpreted by the Court of Cassatie in such a way that, in order to allow a commercial lease to be granted to the general public in principle, it is necessary that the lease to be granted to the general public.From this point of view, it will be possible for the regions to make special arrangements for rental agreements which are currently outside the scope of federal legislation relating to commercial hire, in so far as they correspond to the generic concept of the transferred business, commercial hire'. On the other hand, it is doubtful whether the rental may be regarded as falling within the jurisdiction conferred on the regions in respect of commercial leases, which is also linked to economic activity (for example: liberal professions, medical sector, non-profit sector undertakings) within the scope of the jurisdiction conferred on them by book III, Title VIII, Chapter II, Section IIa, of the Civil Code;Under Article 6 (1) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l))))) (l)))))) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l)) (l)))) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (l) (However, the condition that the tenant has an active establishment unit in the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region is also distinguished in the design from the requirement that a tenant rents one or more commercial premises situated in the Brussels-Capital Region. Consequently, a tenant can benefit from the commercial lease for a commercial property situated in the Brussels-Capital Region in which no activity is exercised, provided that, in addition, he does not have an active establishment unit in the Brussels-Capital Region. However, if a tenant rents a commercial property in the Brussels-Capital Region would not be required to carry out an active establishment in that region, he would not be able to benefit from the commercial lease loan.However, after 25 January 2021, Article 2 of the Ordinance of 23 November 2020 no longer provides a legal basis for the decisions which the Government may take pursuant to Article 18 of the Decree of 23 November 2020."Cette précision fait du prêt au loyer commercial une dette subordonnée pour l'emprunteur, c'est-à-dire détte au rach le plus bas. Grâce à cette propriété, il est plus facile pour le commerçant ou l'artisan en difficulté, s'il en éprouve le besoin, de contracter un autre emprunt auprès d'un organism financier classique: cet organism est rassuré par la certitude de passer avec la Région dans le partage de l'actif en cassation d'activité, par exemple.
